TODAY:
Worked on having particles have trails (as ofPaths) embdedded in the class.
Optimized the particles as much as possible as frame rate was suffering.
Added a GUI so particles could be added in different ways.
Wrote a scene manager such that I could have a seperate interface for designing the vector fields for particles to traverse.
Added GUI for vector field scene with some working parameters.
Struggling to get the vector field to save in a reasonable time as the array is 750k+ vectors long.
  Above isn't necessary for Perlin but it would be useful for the more custom fluid dynamic elements later on.
Vector fields can save to xml files but it takes a while.
